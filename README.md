So this project includes several API. This project has structure that consists of router, views, controllers, models and it works with mongodb atlas. I am using the cluster, so I connect
to mongodb cluster, and there I have the collections. I retrieve the data from collection and render it in ejs files. I have two ways of authorization, one using express-basic-auth to just 
ensure security measures(it is not for the user for production), second is for the user, it should login to use the project. The admin has username yerlan, email yerlan12@gmail.com and password
123123456, for initial auth username: yerlan and password is lolol1. It has history savings. So I use openWeatherApi, openCageApi, flagsApi, booksApi, openStreetMap(just in frontend, don't countt 
as API). I also use express-session for loginned users! Good luck!
